Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 (id)
ii. Hours = 1562 (business_id)
iii. Category = 2643 (business_id)
iv. Attribute = 1115 (business_id)
v. Review = 10000 (id), 8090 (business_id), 9581 (user_id)
vi. Checkin = 493 (business_id)
vii. Photo = 10000 (id), 6493 (business_id)
viii. Tip = 537	(user_id), 3979 (business_id)
ix. User = 10000 (id)
x. Friend = 11 (user_id)
xi. Elite_years = 2780 (user_id)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

+-------------+-------+
| Star Rating | Count |
+-------------+-------+
|         1.5 |     1 |

from business bus
where city = 'Beachwood'
group by stars

Copy and Paste the Resulting Table Below (2 columns â€“ star rating and count):
		
+-------------+-------+
| Star Rating | Count |
+-------------+-------+
|         2.0 |     1 |
|         2.5 |     1 |
|         3.0 |     2 |
|         3.5 |     2 |
|         4.0 |     1 |
|         4.5 |     2 |
|         5.0 |     5 |
+-------------+-------+

7. Find the top 3 users based on their total number of reviews:
		
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
select name, review_count
from user
order by review_count desc
limit 3		

	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
		
+--------+--------------+
| name   | review_count |
+--------+--------------+
| Gerald |         2000 |
| Sara   |         1629 |
| Yuri   |         1339 |
+--------+--------------+

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?
no

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:

select name, review_count, fans
from user
order by fans desc
limit 5

+-----------+--------------+------+
| name      | review_count | fans |
+-----------+--------------+------+
| Amy       |          609 |  503 |
| Mimi      |          968 |  497 |
| Harald    |         1153 |  311 |
| Gerald    |         2000 |  253 |
| Christine |          930 |  173 |
+-----------+--------------+------+

more reviews does not mean that the quality will be good, higher ratings are not necessarily aligned with merely the highest number of reviews. 
in fact, more reviews could mean that people are compelled to post a review due to a bad experience as well.
gerald and harald have high review counts but their number of fans are still not as high as amy and mimi thus implying that their quality of reviews is bad.
Amy has lots of fans because her quality of revuews are higher perhaps and people really value her opinion due to her helpful reviews.
	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: love

	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

select (select count(text)
from review
where text like "%love%") as  loveword, 

(select count(text) 
from review
where text like "%hate%") as hateword

+----------+----------+
| loveword | hateword |
+----------+----------+
|     1780 |      232 |
+----------+----------+
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

select name, fans
from user
order by fans desc
limit 10
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:

+-----------+------+
| name      | fans |
+-----------+------+
| Amy       |  503 |
| Mimi      |  497 |
| Harald    |  311 |
| Gerald    |  253 |
| Christine |  173 |
| Lisa      |  159 |
| Cat       |  133 |
| William   |  126 |
| Fran      |  124 |
| Lissa     |  120 |
+-----------+------+
		

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

The higher starred restuarants are more premium and therefore have shorter hours compared to the restaurants with lower stars. 

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

There is no clear discernible pattern. Some of the higher ranked restaurants have more reviews than the lower ranked group but some have the same amount.
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

Not really since there is no similar location between the two groups. All the zip codes are different.

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT Bus.name,
			   Bus.review_count,
			   Hrs.hours,
			   postal_code,
			   CASE
				  WHEN hours LIKE "%monday%" THEN 1
				  WHEN hours LIKE "%tuesday%" THEN 2
				  WHEN hours LIKE "%wednesday%" THEN 3
				  WHEN hours LIKE "%thursday%" THEN 4
				  WHEN hours LIKE "%friday%" THEN 5
				  WHEN hours LIKE "%saturday%" THEN 6
				  WHEN hours LIKE "%sunday%" THEN 7
			   END AS ord1,
			   CASE
				  WHEN Bus.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '2-3 stars'
				  WHEN Bus.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '4-5 stars'
			   END AS starrat
		FROM business Bus INNER JOIN hours Hrs
		ON Bus.id = Hrs.business_id
		INNER JOIN category Cat
		ON Cat.business_id = Bus.id
		WHERE (Bus.city == 'Las Vegas'
		AND
		Cat.category LIKE 'shopping')
		AND
		(Bus.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3
		OR
		Bus.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5)
		GROUP BY stars,ord1
		ORDER BY ord1,starrat ASC	
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
         
Open business have more reviews left on them than business which are closed.
		
			Open -->   AVG(review_count) = 31.7
			Closed --> AVG(review_count) = 23.2


ii. Difference 2:

Open businesses tend to have slightly higher ratings than closed businesses.
	
			Open -->   AVG(stars) = 3.7
			Closed --> AVG(stars) = 3.5
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(id)),
	 AVG(review_count),
	 SUM(review_count),
	 AVG(stars),
	 is_open
FROM business
GROUP BY is_open

	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         
Predictive analysis on the going concern of a business (ie. if the business will be able to stay open or if it will face foreclosure)

ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
                           
I will need a plethora of data such as number of reviews to determine how popular the business is, the rating of the business to see if the business is highly or lowly rated, the location of the business to see if the business is located in an area which is pristine for business and profitability or not (location will mean we will need city, state, postal_code, and address), the categories of businesses and the attributes of the specific business will be needed as well to determine commonalities of what constitutes as a business which will survive in the long run and which will fail. Is open will determine if the business has stayed in business for a long time or has folded.


iii. Output of your finished dataset:
         
		| id                     | name                           | address                     | city          | state | postal_code | latitude | longitude | review_count | stars | mondayh      | tuesdayh      | wednesdayh      | thursdayh      | fridayh      | saturdayh      | sundayh      | categories                                                                                                                                                                                                 | attributes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | is_open |
